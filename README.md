# LearnWithBrickBreaker
Learning a programming language can be a little tiresome sometimes, but learning while playing a game can make it a bit more interesting. Game-based learning provides much more learning opportunities than expected. Gaming is inherently motivating, which may allow learners to gain skills and knowledge, by leveraging entertainment and weaving it within learning environments. A game named “Learn with Brick Breaker” is essential to serve this purpose. Learning different concepts of java while playing the nostalgic game “Brick Breaker” can be a new and refreshing experience for the learners.

# How to run this :
Run `Projectbb.java` in your IDE, along with all the other files in the same folder. 
The package name should be `projectbb`. 
Additionally, you can convert the entire game into an .exe file after building the project and converting the JAR file to an .exe file.

# How to Play :
Just like traditional BrickBreaker Game you can play it using Right and Left Arrow key from keyboard! The score will be increased if you can answer the question correctly.
This is going to serve as a learning game through which one can choose a topic of java that he/she wants to learn. Then a page containing information about the chosen topic is going to show up on the screen. After reading the text user can continue forward and then some instructions will appear. Finally, the game will start. In the game when the ball touches every 3rd brick a question will pop up out of the screen if the user answers correctly the score will increase by 5 and if the answer is wrong the score will remain the same. This is how our project will work. Also, there is a variety of questions meaning the user can’t predict the questions as they are chosen randomly.
